# Cordova

## What is the RudderStack Cordova SDK?

[**Apache Cordova**](https://cordova.apache.org/) is an open-source, cross-platform application development framework. The RudderStack Cordova SDK lets you track event data from your Cordova app and send it to your preferred destination platforms via RudderStack.

Refer to the [**GitHub repository**](https://github.com/rudderlabs/rudder-sdk-cordova) to access the SDK's codebase and the sample implementation.

## SDK Setup Requirements

* Sign up and log into your [**RudderStack account**](https://app.rudderstack.com/login?type=freetrial).
