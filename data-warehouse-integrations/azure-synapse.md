# Azure Synapse Analytics

[Azure Synapse Analytics](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/synapse-analytics/) is a limitless analytics service that brings together data integration, enterprise data warehousing and big data analytics. It gives you the freedom to query data on your terms, using either serverless or dedicated resourcesâ€”at scale.

RudderStack allows you to configure Azure synapse as a destination to which you can send your event data seamlessly.

## Configuring Azure Synapse in RudderStack

In order to enable sending data to Azure Synapse, you will first need to add it as a destination on the RudderStack dashboard and connect it to your data source. Once the destination is enabled, the tracked source data will automatically start flowing to Azure Synapse via RudderStack.

To configure Azure Synapse as a destination, please follow these steps:

* Configure your data source on RudderStack if you haven't already. You can also simply create a destination and connect it to a source later.

{% hint style="success" %}
Please follow our [Adding a Source and Destination](https://docs.rudderstack.com/how-to-guides/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack) guide to know how to add a source in RudderStack.
{% endhint %}

* After choosing a source, click on the **Add Destination** button and select **Azure Synapse** from the list of destinations.
* Assign a name to your destination and then click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

* Enter the following credentials in the **Connection Settings**: 
  * **Host -** The host name of your Azure Synapse service.
  * **Database -** The database name in your Azure Synapse instance where the data is to be sent.
  * **User** - The username which has the required read/write access to the above database.
  * **Port** - Enter the port number associated with the Azure Synapse database instance.
  * **Password** - The password for the above user.
  * **SSL Mode** - Enter the SSL modes for connecting to your Azure Synapse instance.
  * **Bucket Provider** - Select the intermediate storage for storing the staging files. RudderStack currently supports Amazon S3, MinIO, Google Cloud Storage, and Azure Blob Storage.

{% hint style="success" %}
You can also set the **Sync Frequency** to set the frequency of the data import into your Azure Synapse database. Optionally, you can also specify the time when you want this synchronization to start, by choosing the time under the **Sync Starting At** option.
{% endhint %}

## FAQs

### **How are reserved words handled by RudderStack?**

There are some limitations when it comes to using [reserved words](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/t-sql/language-elements/reserved-keywords-transact-sql?view=sql-server-ver15) in a schema, table, or column names. If such words are used as event names, traits or properties, they will be prefixed with a `_` when  RudderStack creates tables or columns for them in your schema.

Also, it is important to note that integers are not allowed at the start of the schema or table name. Hence, RudderStack prefixes such schema, column or table names with a `_`.

For instance, `'25dollarpurchase'` will be changed by RudderStack to `'_25dollarpurchase`'.

### How does RudderStack handle cases when loading the data into Azure Synapse?

RudderStack converts the event keys into lower case before exporting the data into Azure Synapse, so that it does not create two tables if the event name has two different cases.
