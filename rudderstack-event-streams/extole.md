# Extole

[Extole](https://www.extole.com/) helps you to create an integrated, optimized and effective referral marketing experience for your audience which increases your brand awareness, it provies custom marketing software that increases engagement in your brand ecosystem and increase your conversions.

This document guides you in setting up Extole as a source in RudderStack.

You can send your Extole events to RudderStack by simply adding a webhook pointing to RudderStack. These events includes the reward specific events `reward_earned`,`reward_fulfilled`,`reward_sent` along with other custom events from extole.

## Getting Started

In order to add Extole as a source in RudderStack, please follow these steps:

- From your [RudderStack dashboard](https://app.rudderstack.com/), click on **Add Source**. From the list of sources, select **Extole**, as shown:

![Choose Extole as a source](../.gitbook/assets/ExtoleSource.png)

- Enter the name of your source, and click on **Next**.

![Extole Source](../.gitbook/assets/ExtoleSourceCreate.png)

- Head over to your Extole account and select the `program` you wanted to configure for sending events from. Then, navigate to the **Tech Center** section from the sidebar and then select [Rewards WebHook](https://my.extole.com/tech-center/rewards-webhooks) and create a new Reward Webhook in the view as shown below:

- In the **URL** text box, add a URL pointing to RudderStack in the following format: `<DATA_PLANE_URL>/v1/webhook?writeKey=<YOUR_EXTOLE_SOURCE_WRITE_KEY>`

An example URL should like the following:

```http
https://hosted.rudderlabs.com/v1/webhook?writeKey=1qI4k72gLvHwg2mz24xPCv8gGGK
```

{% hint style="warning" %}
Make sure you add the `writeKey` as query parameter to the URL. This is required to prevent the webhook from failing for the lack of a valid write key.
{% endhint %}

- Finally, save the endpoint.

## RudderStack Event Transformation

The events from Extole are ingested into RudderStack after converting it into the RudderStack event format. For example, the `event_id` set by Extole is set as `properties.eventId`.

The events sent by Extole are converted into a Rudderstack `track` call with a designated name and properties as the entire event received from Extole.

The Event Name of the Events generated by Extole is kept same while mapping to Rudderstack Event Name while RudderStack populates the following properties from Extole event payload to the RudderStack event:

| Extole Property              | RudderStack Property                                          |
| :--------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `event_id`,                  | `properties.eventId`                                          |
| `event_time`                 | `originalTimestamp`                                           |
| `reward_id`                  | `properties.rewardId`                                         |

| `face_value_type`            | `properties.faceValueType`                                    |
| `message`                    | `properties.message`                                          |
| `partner_reward_id`          | `properties.partnerRewardId`                                  |
| `email`                      | `properties.email`                                            |
| `data`                       | `properties.data`                                             |
| `schema_version`             | `properties.schemaVersion`                                    |

{% hint style="warning" %}
All the properties of Extole Events other than `reward_earned`, `reward_fulfilled`, `reward_sent` which are sent to Rudderstack will be directly mapped to Rudderstack Event `properties`.
