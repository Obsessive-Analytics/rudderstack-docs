# Snap Pixel

The [**Snap Pixel**](https://ads.snapchat.com/) is a piece of JavaScript code that helps Advertisers measure the cross-device impact of Campaigns. Advertisers will be able to see how many Snapchatters take action on their website(s) after seeing their Ad.

You can now seamlessly send your event data to Snap Pixel by adding it as a destination in RudderStack.

## Getting Started

Before configuring Snap Pixel as a destination in RudderStack, verify if the source platform is supported by Snap Pixel by referring to the table below: Ì¦

| **Connection Mode** | **Web**       | **Mobile** | **Server** |
| :------------------ | :------------ | :--------- | :--------- |
| **Device mode**     | **Supported** | -          | -          |
| **Cloud mode**      | -             | -          | -          |

{% hint style="info" %}
To know more about the difference between Cloud mode and Device mode in RudderStack, refer to the [**RudderStack connection modes**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/get-started/rudderstack-connection-modes) guide.
{% endhint %}

Once you have confirmed that the source supports sending events to Snap Pixel, perform the steps below:

* From your [**RudderStack dashboard**](https://app.rudderstack.com/), add the source. From the list of destinations, select **Snap Pixel**.

{% hint style="info" %}
Follow our guide on [**How to Add a Source and Destination in RudderStack**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/how-to-guides/adding-source-and-destination-rudderstack) for more information.
{% endhint %}

* Give a name to the destination and click on **Next**. You should then see the following screen:

### Configuration Settings

To successfully configure Snap Pixel as a destination, you will need to configure the following settings:

* **Snap Pixel ID:** Enter your Snap Pixel ID here.

{% hint style="info" %}
For more information on how to find your Snap Pixel ID, refer to the FAQs below.
{% endhint %}

* **Hashing Method:** Snap Pixel lets you pass a user parameter (email or phone number) in both hashed and non-hashed formats in it's init call. If **SHA-256** is chosen as an option, RudderStack will hash-encode the provided user parameter (email or the phone number).

## Identify

{% hint style="warning" %}
The Snap Pixel will not be initialized unless `identify` call is fired.
{% endhint %}

{% hint style="info" %}
A user parameter (email or phone number) is needed for the snap pixel code to be loaded. So, while loading rudderstack will check for those from the cookies. If found, then, the web snippet is loaded fully else `identify` call with email/phone is required for that.
{% endhint %}

In Snap Pixel, the `identify` call initializes the Snap Pixel snippit code.

For more information on the `identify` call, check out the [**RudderStack API spec**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-api/rudderstack-spec/identify).

A sample `identify` call is as shown:

```javascript
      rudderanalytics.identify({
          email: "sample@sample.com",
          phone: "8787857564"
      });
```

Either or both of the following user parameters should be passed in identify:

| **RudderStack User Parameter**  | **Snap Pixel User Parameter** |
| :-------------------------- | :---------------------------- |
| `email` | `user_email` |
| `phone` | `user_phone_number` |

## Page

When the `page` call is made, the `snaptr("track", "PAGE_VIEW")` is sent.
You can also send payload with the rudderstack `page` call.

For more information on the `page` call, check out the [**RudderStack API spec**](https://docs.rudderstack.com/rudderstack-api/rudderstack-spec/page).

A sample `page` call is as shown:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.page();
```

## Track

The `track` call lets you send Snap Pixel events.

A sample track call is as shown below:

```javascript
rudderanalytics.track('PURCHASE', {
    'currency': 'USD',
    'price': 333.33,
    'transaction_id': '11111111'
});
```

You can also send the following RudderStack Ecommerce Events.
