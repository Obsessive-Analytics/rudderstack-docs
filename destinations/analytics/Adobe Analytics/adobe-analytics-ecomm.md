Steps for sending Ecomm events to adobe.

1. Channel, Campaign, state, zip window properties are updated.
2. Sets timestamp according to dashboard settings.
3. currencyCode window property is set.
4. Event string if mapped on dashboard is set.
5. Product string if mapped on dashboard is set.
6. contextData, eVars, lists, hiers, props are set.
7. linkTrackVars is set.
8. Mapped adobe event is set.
9. tl() is called. The tl() method is an important core component to Adobe Analytics. It takes all Analytics variables defined on the page, compiles them into an image request,and sends that data to Adobe data collection servers. It works similarly to the t() method, however this method does not increment page views. It is useful for tracking links and other elements that wouldnâ€™t be considered a full page load.
