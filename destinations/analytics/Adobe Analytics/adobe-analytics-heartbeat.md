## Adobe Heartbeat Events

Adobe Analytics for Streaming Media is an add-on to Adobe Analytics that provides powerful measurement tools for audio, video, and advertisements. Adobe Analytics is part of the Adobe Experience Platform.

For sending heartbeat events to develop first you need the heartbeat tracking server url. You can contact your Adobe representative for the url. Second, you need to map your rudder events with the type of adobe heartbeat event you want to send as. There is a toggle for ssl which if turned on will send heartbeat tracking url as https.

Playback head:

For sending video heartbeats event to Adobe through js sdk , Media heartbeat SDK needs a playhead update at least once per second for the main content. The Video/Ad start and heartbeat update playhead type of events updates this playhead using the position property. To stop triggering this event for every second, the playhead to the window needs to be set. This can be done by setting window.rudderHBPlayheads to the key-value pair of the current contentâ€™s session_id and position:

window.rudderHBPlayheads = { "session_id": position value }
